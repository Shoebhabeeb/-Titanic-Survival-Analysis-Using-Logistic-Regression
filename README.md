# Titanic-Survival-Analysis-Using-Logistic-Regression
Statistical implemention of a Generalized Linear Model(GLM) model to predict the survival rate of passenger

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This
resulted in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. We observe that there was some
element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to
survive than others. I would like to build a Generalized Linear Model - Logistic Regression
model to predict the probability that someone lived on the titanic using passenger data (i.e. name,
age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).
In this paper, after all the assumptions are met, we build a Generalized Linear model, i.e.
Logistic Regression and interpret the estimated coefficients in terms of the predicted survival
odds. Create confidence intervals for the coefficient estimates and the coefficient standard errors.
Now I would like to estimate the proportion of incorrectly predicted outcomes with the correctly
predicted outcomes using Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to see a graphical display of
the predictive ability of the model
